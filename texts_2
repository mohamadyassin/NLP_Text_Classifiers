SRTP Building 1 will be located in San Diego on Hoyt Park Drive. Murphy \nDevelopment Company (the \"Borrower\") currently owns the land and is seeking to develop the property with a 3-year, interest-only construction loan. \nThe Property will be a two-story, state-of-the-art R&D/ high finish industrial building exceptionally well located in an amenity filled business park in central San Diego. \nBuilding 1 is scheduled to break ground Q3 2019 with the expectation for the first of the tenants to move-in summer 2020. SRTP currently features seven existing \nbuildings occupied by Aetna, Anchor General, CoreLogic, Mission Federal Credit Union and Paychex and four proposed buildings to be developed by Murphy \nDevelopment Company (\"MDC\"). On-site amenities surrounding the business park include hiking and mountain bike trails, sports field, cafe and access to Evan's \nPond and Miramar Lake. \nIn September of 2014, MDC purchased five lots, including the subject lots 7 & 8, at the Scripps Ranch Business Park III from Intel Corporation. Murphy then \nrebranded their 5 lots as the Scripps Ranch Technology Park. As a result of limited supply and strong demand, the Borrower recently received an appraisal for the land \nat $40 PSF. The Borrower has a $61.3M ($370 PSF) development budget for the subject properly. Asking rents are estimated to be $2.30/SF NNN per month with a \ntenant improvement package of $70 PSF. \nIt has been 10 years since an R&D building has been delivered in Central San Diego. MDC will start construction on the project given the tight market conditions and \nlimited availability of similar quality product. There are 26 active requirements for like space being tracked by CBRE. \nSan Diego-based Murphy Development master-plans and develops multiphase corporate industrial and technology parks. Since its establishment in 1984, the \ncompany has master planned and developed more than 10,000,000 SF of projects throughout San Diego County, with current projects in the Otay Mesa and Scripps \nRanch submarkets. \nPROPERTY SUMMARY \nREQUEST SUMMARY \nADDRESS \nSEC Hoyt Park Dr & Scripps Ranch Blvd \nTOTAL COSTS \n$61,306,642 ($370 PSF) \nSan Diego, CA 92131 \nRETURN ON COSTS \n7.01% \nCONSTRUCTION \nEst. 2020 \nSTABILIZED CAP RATE: \nCOMPLETION \n6.00% \nSTABILIZED VALUE: \n$71,630,000 ($432 PSF) \nSQUARE FEET \n165,806 SF \nLOAN REQUEST: \n$45,600,000 ($275 PSF) \nLOAN TO COST: \n74% \nLAND AREA \n557,567 SF (12.8 Acres) \nLOAN TO STABILIZED VALUE: \n64% \nON-SITE PARKING \nRatio - 1,000 SF (550 spaces; expandable) \nStabilized NOI - $4,297,533 \nDEBT YIELD \n9.42% \nAPN \n319-170-26, 319-170-27 \nDSCR \n1.31x \nFINANCE REQUEST \nScripps Ranch Technology Park \n", "BOXER PROPERTY \n(978) 696-RENT \n85 Swanson Road \n(7368) \nLeasing@BoxerProperty.com \nSuite: 110 \nRSF: 6,783 \nFeatures: Ground floor location.

The location is in a major retail corridor and is situated \nadjacent to a Super Wal-Mart and near the Benbrook Mall. \nThe trade area shows strong household income ($90k) and steady population growth. Fort Worth Naval Air Station and \nTexas Christian University bring 30k+ personnel and students to the trade area. The City of Benbrook, Texas is a vibrant \nand steadily growing suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth MSA. The local community features major public and private \ninfrastructure including Texas Christian University and proximity to the Fort Worth Naval Air Base together, accounting \nfor nearly 30,000 students and service members. \nThe site itself is situated in a highly desirable location for long term stability. The demographics surrounding the site are \nappealing for both a storage user and retail tenants with household incomes in the $90k range. The current mix of \nrenters to owners is approximately 40%, which is ideal for maintaining a high level of storage demand. \nThe overall supply of storage in this market, at less than 3 sf per capita, is extremely low, and there are no climate- \ncontrolled storage competitors within the trade area. This kind of constrained supply with strong demand leads to \ncontinued rent growth beyond physical stabilization. \nThe property is strongly positioned to capture traffic with its multiple entry ways, good signage and view from the \nstreet. Its location on the \"going-home\" side of the entry to the major interstate is ideal for diverting workers on their \nway back from work. \nIn addition to being located in an established retail corridor with close proximity to a regional mall and other strong \nretail centers including a Super Wal-Mart, the location has two major sources of demand growth. The first that a large \nretail power center is being built less than a mile east from the site, and the second is a large multifamily and SFR \n(2,000+ unit) development complex is being built directly to the west from the site. \nThe site already receives a substantial amount of traffic and views from the north south axis on Route 377, but the new \ndevelopments will add more traffic and views along the east west axis. Situated between a major housing development \nand a new power center is a recipe for increased traffic and stable demand over the long term.

The subject property currently consists of three buildings totaling 58,336 sf, a \n26,880 sf concrete tilt-up building and a 31,456 sf metal building, all located on 2.97 acres of land (129,373 sf). \nUpon acquisition of the asset, WHC will demolish the 31,456 sf metal building, improve the 26,880 sf concrete \ntilt-up building and improve the 75,613 sf of excess land with perimeter site fencing and exterior lighting. \nUpon completion of the improvements, WHC intends to lease the asset to a single-tenant who would be able to \nutilize the excess land as yard storage and sell as a leased investment. Additionally, WHC can exit the investment \nvia a sale to an owner-user. The completion of the demo and capital improvements to the building and excess \nland is estimated to take 4 months and lease up is estimated to take 3 months. Rental income commences in \nmonth 9 after a 1 month rent abatement. In total, WHC is assuming a 12 month business plan. \nAt acquisition, the asset will be 100% vacant which will allow WHC the near term opportunity to attract \nprospective tenants and buyers in a market with limited available space (current Orange County submarket \nvacancy of 2.3%). Trussworks International, who previously occupied the asset for metal fabrication, is in process \nof relocating to another building within the Southern California. Upon stabilization, the NOI is estimated to be \n$622,000. Assuming a 4.75% interest rate and a 30 year amortization, the DSCR is estimated to be 1.33 based \non the $7,390,000 requested loan amount (68% LTC). Applying a 5.15% cap rate to the NOI generates a stabilized \nvalue of $12,090,000, the estimated loan to value would be 61%. \nWHC has structured the purchase and sale agreement with a 45-day due diligence period and a 15-day close \nthereafter with close of escrow scheduled for March 8, 2020. As previously reference, we are seeking a non- \nrecourse acquisition bridge loan in the amount of $7,390,000 to acquire the asset, complete the improvements, \nstabilize and dispose of the asset. \nOWNERSHIP/SPONSOR \nThis acquisition will mark the fifth acquisition for WHC and Eric Ruehle/Adam Deierling, the firm's \nfounders. Prior to the launch of WHC, both Mr. Ruehle & Mr. Deierling enjoyed long careers in the institutional \nindustrial real estate business as an owner and operator of value add institutional assets in Southern California \nand the West. More information on the partners can be found here: https://www.westharborcap.com/. \nAttached to this loan request are case studies from WHC. \nWithin the last year, WHC has implemented similar business plans to two assets located in Southern California \nwhich are summarized on the following page: \n", "831 S R L Thornton Fwy \n$749,580 \nBishop Arts Property, I-35E Frontage Access, 5 miles \nSouth of the center of Downtown Dallas, Survey \ncompleted DEC 2019, Renovated in 2017.

Currently, the property houses 18 tenants across 37 suites. \nOperating Expenses (2017) \n$989,314 \nRent PSF \n$53.17/YR \nProperty Highlights: \nCurrent Occupancy \n92.7% \nStaggered lease expirations through 2020, with gross rental rates that are \n4.8% below market on average \nPROJECT SUMMARY \n290 parking spaces, boasting a parking ratio of 3.8:1,000 \nProject Name \nLos Altos Plaza \nPerimeter forested with mature trees and abundant greenery for curb appeal \nSponsor \nDutchints Developments LLC \nSubject has been well maintained, with no visibly deferred upkeep \nProperty Type \nMulti-Tenant Class-B Office \nAwarded Energy Star label in 2016 and 2017 for its operating efficiency \nOwnership Type \nFee Simple \nThe Site is located on El Camino Real, a densely trafficked corridor offering easy \nYear Built \n1982 \naccess to an abundance of nearby amenities. Within a 1 mile radius, tenants can \nAddress \n5150 E1 Camino Real \nfind dozens of restaurants, grocers, and retail outlets, especially in the thriving \nCity/State \nLos Altos, California \nVillage at San Antonio shopping center. Also within 1 mile is San Antonio \nCurrent Zoning \nCommercial Thoroughfare, City of Los Altos \nStation, which runs north into San Francisco and south towards Santa Clara. For \ncommuters, access to the 101, 237, 85, or 280 freeways is within 3 miles of the \nBuilding Area (SF) \n77,619 \nSubject. Google's Mountain View Headquarters and Stanford University are \nLand Area (Acres / SF) \n3.8/165,354 \nboth also nearby. \nNumber of Stories \n3 \nThe Sponsor is seeking to obtain acquisition financing to account for \nParking Spaces \n290 Spaces \n3.8:1,000 \napproximately 50% of the project, equating to a commitment of approximately \n$27 million (total cost estimated to be $54 million including closing costs). The proposed business plan is to operate the existing office building while \nsimultaneously \nobtaining the necessary entitlements with the City of Los Altos. There is limited lease exposure given that most of the in-place leases roll in the second year and the \nSponsor \nexpects entitlements to be obtained inside of 12 months (due to strong interest in fast-tracking entitlement process, typically entitlements require a minimum of \n24 months). In the event entitlements are not received, leases can be extended or new leases can be made. \nOnce \nentitlements are achieved, the Property will either be developed by the Sponsor into Multi-Family product (approximately $177MM total cost) or sold as a \nredevelopment opportunity to a third party builder. \nGEORGE SMITH PARTNERS \n[4] \nLOS ALTOS PLAZA \n", "so, \n2 \nI \n< \nGOLDEN AVI AUTTS \nProperty Overview \n", "Dollar General Overview \nDollar General (NYSE: DG) is a chain of more than 15,000 discount stores in 44 states, \nDemographics \nNews \nprimarily in the South, East, Midwest, and Southwest, offering basic household items, such \n3 Miles \n5 Miles \n10 Miles \nDollar General is Dominating in America.

Troy is currently responsible for leasing and operations at an \nestablished music studio facility in LA. At that facility, Troy directly manages one hundred and fifty (150) \nseparate studio and rehearsal units. The facility is in proximity to the subject property and is 100% leased \nwith a waiting list (despite being aged, lacking high-quality sound-proofing, and having HVAC issues). \nIndustry Relationships \nTroy has deep relationships within the music industry, specific to prospect tenants (individual and \ncorporate). Pre-leasing efforts have already commenced, with the expectation that at least half of the \nstudio and rehearsal space will have \"soft\" commitments by tenant prospects by the time that renovation \nis complete. \nHigh-End Positioning \nThe property will offer a high-end, quality positioning and attract established recording artists that are \ncurrently looking for an \"upgrade\" on their current rented space. Sponsor will capture higher rent by \noffering semi-customized 1st generation buildouts that will provide tenants with a sense of ownership and \ncommunity. The typical lease term is targeted for six to twelve months for the larger spaces, with shorter \nmonthly lease terms for the smaller rehearsal spaces. \nTenant profiles include: \nNew Bands: \nTypically have open-ended space needs for rehearsal and recording. \nTeachers / Songwriters: Seeking professional environment and central location in West LA. \nEstablished Bands: \nSeveral established bands that live/perform locally are asking for \"first looks\" on \nspace as they are currently driving one hour to access quality recording space. \n(San Fernando Valley studio locations) \nCorporate Studios: \nSponsorship has existing relationships with major studios (Universal Music, \nViacom, Sony) who often access 3rd party space for their musicians. \nRenovation Plan \nProperty has been owner occupied by a real estate company, and is generating studio-related income \nfrom only half of the building, leaving significant upside from additional studio square footage alone. \nRenovation timeline \n6 to 12 month (staged renovations) \nStudio Specs \nSemi-custom buildouts for 1st gen tenants, institutional quality acoustic \nwall treatments, split HVAC systems, upgraded lighting and electrical \nStabilized Occupancy \nwithin 6 months of opening \nPreliminary Layouts \nto follow \nFull Budget \nto follow \n2114 Pico Blvd \nPage 5 \n", "8 CARLSBAD LAGOON UNITS \n4560 & 66 COVE DR. \nProperty Overview \nAPPROXIMATE \nUnit Mix \n# OF UNITS \nSQUARE FEET \nCURRENT RENT \nMARKET RENT \n4560 COVE DR. \n$1,600 \n$1,850 \n2 bed, 1.5 bath twnh + \n3 \n850 \n$1,850 \n$2,250 \n1cg \n2 bed, 2 bath, + 1 c gar. \n1 \n850 \n$1,875 \n$2,250 \n4566 COVE DR. \n2 bed, 2 bath + 1 C gar. \n2 \n850 \n$1,850 \n$2,400 \n3 bed, 2 bath + 1 C gar. \n1 \n1000 \n$2,400 \n$2,700 \n2 bed, 1.5 bath twnh + \n1 \n850 \n$1,850 \n$2,250 \n1cg 1 \nAnnual Gross Income \n$238,800 \n$277,740 \nLIST PRICE: \n$4,200,000 \nTOTAL UNITS: \n8 \nPRICE/UNIT: \n$512,500 \nPRICE/SF: \n$600 \nGRM: \n22.76/18.67 \nAPN: \n207-150-10 & 09 \nAPPROX.

This development is eligible to participate in the Opportunity Zone Program \nwhich can deliver significant tax advantages to investors. \nSite Highlights: \nAcquired property at 65 percent of market rate for built product \nPurchase price @ $259/SF compared to average for sale comps @ $410/SF \n19,207 SF bow-truss creative office/studio/warehouse \n1,980 SF retail/office fronting LA River \n3,900 SF office fronting Blake Ave \nConstructed in conjunction with new residential product \nDedicated parking of 2+ spaces per 1,000 SF (located on Blimp site) \nCovenant on parking ensures dedicated parking for 1801 Blake \nLa Colombe Coffee - Frogtown LA \nOpportunity ZONE \n4 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nADVISORS O \nDEVELOPMENT REAL ESTATE SERVICES \n", "OPPORTUNITY ZONE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY \nTAX FREE CAPITAL GAINS - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA \nAdjacent \nDevelopment Site \n(not a part) \nOpportunity ZONE \n1 \nADVISOR A D V I S O R S \nDEVELOPMENT REAL ESTATE SERVICES \n", "Retail Presence, Reno \nwigge \nPeavine Creek \n3lvd \nReservoir \nNest Wash \nReservoir \nWalmart \nO'Reilly \nmy \nSUPERCENTIX \nARCO \nClayton Middle School \nSt. Albert the Great \nCatholic School \nPeavine Creek \nW \nLower \nElmcrest \nMae-Anne Avei- 19.750 VPD \nPeavine Creek \nSUBJECTO \nElementary School \n(chilis \nReservoir \nW7th St \nAve \nSAFEWAY \n- a TIRES \n80 \nDwight-D.

Located right on the water within walking distance of the \npier and downtown area. It is rare that coastal properties this close to the sea become available, even more \nso one that hosts an extraordinary twenty-one units. \nInitially, two properties built in different eras were joined together in the 1970s by matching \nits \nSpanish-Mission style architecture. Lands End is an oceanfront property comprised of 21 units in 4 \nseparate buildings, including studios, one-bedrooms, and a large 3-bedroom unit. In addition, there are 14 \nindividual single Car Garages with new garage doors. This property remains as stunning as ever with a \nbrand-new roof and well-maintained stucco and paint. All units are currently turn-key ready and have \neither been remodeled or rehabilitated under its current management. There is an opportunity for an \ninvestor to increase rents by further remodeling units with a trendy beach vibe design that will attract \nrenters wanting modern design and beach living. \nNew building ordinances prohibit building above street-level. Land's End, which was built before the \nrestrictive laws were implemented, is still able to enjoy its elevated third-floor views. Now with better views \nthan ever with all newly built property situated lower, confined to street-level. Even Land's End's \none-of-a-kind deck sits higher than the street, allowing guests to enjoy the ocean views above passersby. \nAlthough Land's End has recently been operated partly as a vacation rental and partly as monthly \napartment rentals, our analysis of the cost of operating vacation rental makes it clear that the more \nprofitable path for a buyer is to discontinue vacation rentals and convert the all of the units to monthly \napartment rentals. We have therefore provided conservative pro forma financials supporting a 3.63% CAP \nrate once all the units are leased to monthly tenants. Since only 8 of the units are currently being offered \nas vacation rentals, this conversion could be accomplished within a few months after closing escrow. \nLand's End is well loved by those who call it home and those who choose to make it a vacation destination. \nOFFERING MEMORANDUM \n308 THE STRAND OCEANSIDE CA 92054 \nPROPERTY NFORMATIO \n5 \n", "o \nit \nThis information has been secured from sources we believe to be reliable, but we make no representations or warranties; expressed or \nimplied as to the accuracy of the information References to square footage are approximate Buyer must verify the information and bears all \nMarcus & Millichap \nrisk for any inaccuracies Marcus & Millichap is a service mark of 2017 Marcus & Millichap All rights reserved \n", "MARO \nAT SHOREVIEW \nOffering Memorandum \nTHE MARQ AT SHOREVIEW \nMarcus & Millichap \nSan Mateo, CA \n", "DRAPER TRIPLEX \nMARKETING TEAM \nGregory Colligan \nAssociate \nTel: (858) 373-3286 \nFax: (858) 373-3110 \ngregory.colligan@marcusmillichap.com \nLicense: CA 01943461 \nBio \nGregory Colligan of Marcus & Millichap is a highly focused multi housing group \nspecialist.

The property \nis 90% leased with trending rents and benefits from a supply constrained self-storage market. \nNew Britain Self Storage Super Center, has a superlative location at the confluence of Main Street, Yankee \nExpressway freeway [I-84] system, a north south freeway system connecting to New York City, and the east west 72 \nfreeway to downtown. The current population mix of renters to owners is approximately 50%, which is ideal for \nmaintaining a high level of storage demand with strong trending demographics. \nThe property is strongly positioned to capture traffic with its multiple entry ways, good signage and view from the \nstreet. Its location on Main Street, the major corridor connecting to the freeway, is ideal for capturing daily vehicular \ntraffic to and from New Britain, as well as, commuter traffic. \nThe site itself is situated in a highly desirable location for long term stability. The demographics surrounding the site \nare appealing for both a storage user and retail tenants with household incomes in the $72k range. The current mix \nof renters to owners is approximately 50%, which is ideal for maintaining a high level of storage demand. \nThe overall supply of storage in this market, at less than 3 sf per capita is low. This kind of constrained supply with \nstrong demand leads to continued rent growth beyond physical stabilization. \n", "The Point Apartments \nSAN DIEGO, CA \nPRICING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nFINANCING \nExisting Financing \nLoan Type \nFree and Clear \nProposed Financing \nFirst Trust Deed \nLoan Amount \n$844,500 \nLoan Type \nAll Cash \nInterest Rate \n4.2% \nAmortization \n30 Years \nDebt Coverage Ratio \n1.49 \nThis information has been secured from sources we believe to be reliable, but we make no representations or warranties, expressed or implied, as to \nthe accuracy of the information.

It is situated on a corner \n329 \nparcel totaling approximately 6,914 saft of land zoned R3. There is \ncurrently at least 9 surface parking spaces (4 in the two driveways in \nMadison St \nthe front off of Walnut Ave, 1 in the front driveway off of Madison St, \nand at least 4 additional rear parking spaces located in the alley). \nAdditional parking could be achieved by implementing tandem \nparking in the front driveways, which would add an additional 5 \nspaces. There are also 5 garages currently used as storage. \nOwned long-term by current ownership since 1996, the property has \nbeen well maintained, and several of the units have been more \nrecently renovated. Current rents are substantially below market, and \nthus the Property represents an excellent value-add opportunity for \nastute investors to fix up the units and increase cash flow. There is \nroughly 50% upside in the rents, and the possibility to add additional \nstorage income, for a total income upside of 61% \nWell-located in Coastal Carlsbad, the asset is .8 miles from Carlsbad \nState Beach, .5 miles from Carlsbad Village, and is a 5-minute walk to \nPine Ave Park immediately to the Southest, allowing tenants to easily \nenjoy all that Coastal Carlsbad has to offer. \n5 \n", "12905 Garvey Avenue is a unique low-coverage industrial building with freeway visibility located in Baldwin \nPark. The asset was located on 3.36 acres where the vacancy rate was approximately 1.5% and there was limited \nland available for new development. WHC executed a lease with a national credit tenant (Sunstate Equipment) \nand sold as a leased investment to CenterPoint Properties. \n555 Harbor Boulevard is an e-commerce distribution property located in Orange County which offers efficient \naccess to the greater Southern California population. Upon close of escrow, the site was occupied by 32 tenant \nwho were vacated within 6 months after close of escrow which allowed WHC to redevelop the site. Prior to \ncompleting the redevelopment, the site was leased by FedEx. WHC worked with the City of La Habra to secure \nCity entitlements needed to redevelop and operate the site as an e-commerce fulfillment yard. \nThe equity partners on the transaction will be a small handful of very sophisticated high net worth \ninvestors. Each investor created their net worth in real estate operations and now provide equity capital to \nentrepreneurial real estate sponsors. They bring not only financial but intellectual capital to the partnership as \nwell and each investor has invested in the 18221 Susana Road, 10871 Forbes Avenue and 555 Harbor Avenue \ntransactions. \nORANGE COUNTY INDUSTRIAL MARKET INFO \nThe Orange County industrial market (257M SF) continues to experience strong investment fundamentals with \nthe vacancy rate at 2.3% and minimal new construction (1.2M SF). There are currently no competing low \ncoverage buildings on the market. \nOwner-users and investors alike are engaging in bidding contests over a limited supply of properties on the \nmarket for sale. Expansion from the e-commerce, healthcare, home building and high-tech manufacturing \nsectors have created additional demand in an already supply constrained market. \nPROJECT ECONOMICS / PROJECT VALUATION \nUpon stabilization of the project in month 12, the property is estimated to have an NOI of approximately \n$622,000. Assuming a conservative cap rate of 5.15% (market cap rates are 4.50% to 4.75%), the property would \nhave a capitalized value of $12,090,000 which results in a loan to stabilized value of 61%. \nRent \n2850 Coronado Industrial Project Valuation: \nBldg \n26,880 \n$ \n0.90 \n$ \n24,192 \nExcess Land \n75,613 \n$ \n0.38 \n$ \n28,733 \nNOI: \n$622,397 \n$ \n0.41 \n$ \n52,925 \nValue at cap rate of \n5.15% \n$12,090,000 \nLTV: \n61% \nDisposition Valuation \nNOI assumes a rental rate of $0.90 psf for the 26,880 sf \nindustrial building and a rental rate of $0.38 psf for the \nBldg \n26,880 \n$ \n240.00 \n$ \n6,451,200 \nExcess Land \n75,613 \n$ \n73.93 \n75,613 sf excess land. \n$ \n5,590,076 \nOn a blended basis, the UW rental rate is $0.41 psf (total \n$ \n12,041,276 \nland square footage of 129,373 sf) \n", "Investment Overview: \n11414 Menlo Ave. Los Angeles, CA \nLocated between Vermont Ave and Hoover St just off of Imperial Hwy, and less than a mile from Los Angeles Southwest College.

This 5,640 square foot complex sits just a few blocks south of Balboa park resting on a 7,000 square foot lot. Select \nunits include views of downtown, french doors facing out onto private fenced in yards and hardwood floors. The property consists \nof a two story spanish-style building and a second 1-story building collectively composed of six 1-bedroom / 1-bath units and five \nstudios units. There are 2 off-street spaces available with additional street easily accessible to tenants and a shared courtyard with \nlush garden landscaping. Owners benefit from the city paying for the trash expense and several new water heaters, fridges and \nstoves in select units. The property has mostly ABS piping under the building and the main and clean under the main building have \nbeen recently replaced. \nThe historic Golden Hill community has gone through a rapid gentrification, while still retaining the architectural style from its rich \nhistory as one of San Diego's communities for the wealthy elite. Golden Hill provides excellent access to some of San Diego's \nprime attractions such as downtown, Balboa Park and the neighboring urban mesa neighborhoods. Its location gives it \ntremendous accessibility to the I-5 and 94 freeways, making it easy for tenants to commute within the core San Diego area. This \ncomplex offers an investor an opportunity to own a property with value-add upside in a core San Diego neighborhood that has \ntightening vacancy rates and accelerating rent growth. \nPROPERTY OVERVIEW \nPrime location in a Recently Redeveloped Golden Hill \nResidential Community \nMix of 1-Bedroom / 1-Bath and Studio Units Ideal For Young \nGolden Hill Demographic \nSelect Units with Private Fenced Yards \nUnits with Hardwood Floors and French Doors \nEasy Downtown and Freeway Access \nMarcus & Millichap \n5 \n", "THE PALMS RESORT and CAFE ON THE BEACH \nThe Palms Resort and Cafe On The Beach have a strong track record of steady growth and very profitable operations. 2018 re- \nsults \ndelivered revenue of nearly $2.3 million with a net profit of $591,900. The greatest upside potential for both revenue and \nprofit growth lie in the hotel operations. The SPI CVB recently released a report that confirms The Palms Resort has 45% upside \npotential in occupancy in order to be at par with the average occupancy for South Padre Island. Although currently very profita- \nble, any increase in occupancy in the hotel would generate significant net profit growth because no capital investment would be \nrequired. With better rate management, event marketing, and targeted advertising, hotel revenue could increase to $750,000 \nper year (to be on par with the 2017 average REVPAR for South Padre Island). \nWith the recent two-story addition, the Resort now has meeting facilities for 30 persons, an attractive lobby/gift shop, adminis- \ntrative area, maintenance area, and in-house laundry facility with storage for housekeeping supplies. The sale is \"turnkey\" with \noperating supplies, inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment all included in the purchase price. \nThe Cafe On The Beach generates 75% of the revenue, and 77% of the net profit for this enterprise. The Palms Resort (hotel) \nholds the greatest potential for increased revenue and significant increased net profit. For every dollar of increased hotel sales, \nmore than 90% of it will fall to the bottom line. Both entities employ experienced, long-term employees. The enterprise (Cafe \nand Hotel) is managed by a very seasoned and capable on-site manager.

As a result the risk of new supply \nis \nsmall. Including the Property, only four new hotels have been developed in Key Largo in the past 20 years. \nAttractive Basis \nThe Sponsor acquired the land from a bank after it was foreclosed on. Prior developers failed to obtain entitlements for the hotel. Upon acquiring the land, \nthe Sponsor created tremendous value in the land (five years of work), and ultimately entitled the site. The Sponsor acquired the site for approximately \n$2.2MM and has since increased its value to $7.0MM per a 2019 appraisal. \nStrong Market Fundamentals \nThere is a limited supply of hotels in the Florida Keys due to stringent development regulations and limited amounts of land. As a result, the market enjoys \nhigh occupancy rates and ADRs and NOI margins are strong. Strong market fundamentals, irreplaceable oceanfront real estate and extremely high barriers to \nentry all converge to create a \"trophy market\" where investors pay high prices per key to gain entry. Since the Sponsor acquired the land without \nentitlements, the cost basis in the project is low which significantly protects a lender's investment. \nConstruction Ready \nOver the past five years, the Sponsor obtained all entitlements and permits. As well, construction drawings are complete and can commence construction \nwithin 30 days of loan closing. Construction of the Property will take approximately 12 months. \nIrreplaceable Ocean Front Location \nFishing and diving are major demand generators for the Florida Keys and Key Largo in particular which is known as the \"Diving Capital of the World.\" When \nguests \nvisit \nthe \nFlorida \nKeys, \nthey \nhave \nthe \noption \nof \nstaying \non \nthe \nGulf \nof \nMexico \nside \nor \nthe \nAtlantic \nOcean \nside \nof \nthe \nOverseas \nHighway; \nthe \nonly \nroad \nthat \ngoes in and out of the Florida Keys. The Atlantic Ocean is the preferred side for both fishing and diving and therefore hotels located on that side are more \nprone to capture the fishing and diving demand in the market. Guests that stay on the Gulf of Mexico are forced to leave their hotels to go on fishing and \ndiving excursions. The Hotel will have a competitive advantage against other hotels in the market due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean. Note that the \nPlaya Largo Marriott Autograph Resort is located on the Gulf of Mexico. \nSales Comparables \nWhile there are very few comparable properties that trade, the most applicable is the Oceans Edge Hotel & Marina in Key West which was acquired by \nSunstone Hotel Investors in July, 2017. The property is a 175-bed hotel that traded at $1.00MM per bed. On average, comparable sales over since July 2017 \nhave traded at approximately $730K per bed.

The Master tenant collects an incentive-based fee of 22% of the \nproperty NOI to compensate for expenses incurred directly. The parties of the master lease are related \nparties and have structured the master lease to be compliant with standard lending practices. \nCampus of Life, LLC will staff and provide classes for Campus of Life (\"COL\"), the on-site education for \nAscent.

In addition to its 1,462,482 square feet of \nretail space, which is anchored by an attractive mix of shopping, convenience, grocery and fitness options, the portfolio also includes 44,017 square feet \nof medical office space and eight residential units, as well as the ability to add over 80,000 square feet on two pad sites. \nThis mixed-use offering is driven by a host of fundamentally desirable investment characteristics, including existing leases to a variety of major \nnational and regional retailers, high-performing stores within excellent local communities, superior demographics and strong locations within mature \nand well-established markets where retail centers of this size rarely trade. Furthermore, current ownership has invested a total of $10 million in capital \nimprovements, including parking lot, HVAC, roof, landscaping and facade upgrades, throughout the portfolio since 2009.

It is known for its affordable pubs, \nrestaurants, coffee houses, antique shops, book shops, and burgeoning arts community. \nGiven its location in central San Diego, Normal Heights is among some of the older neighborhoods in the county. Most \nof the housing in the area was built in the early 1900's, as the present city of San Diego began to grow. During the post \nWorld War II boom, the influx of a larger population necessitated denser housing, and the development of a multitude \nof apartment complexes. Well over half of the neighborhoods housing units are multifamily housing. \nAs San Diego City began to grow, the addition of a trolley during the 1920's allowed residents to begin moving north. \nNormal Heights began as such an expansion. Three decades later as the birth of suburbs and mass use of automobiles \ncoupled with a booming population lead to residents moving further north, and eventually out of the city. \nNormal Heights continued to provide housing while many of the original properties were developed into multifamily \nhousing. \nThis information has been secured from sources we believe to be reliable, but we make no representations or warranties, expressed or implied, as to \nthe accuracy of the information.

(\"HFF\") to arrange construction take out financing for \nAscent, a 84-unit upscale luxury apartment community in the prestigious Scripps Ranch neighborhood of \nSan Diego. The property is located at 10785 Pomerado Rd, San Diego, CA 92131. The site is located in an \nexclusive area of Scripps Ranch, just south of Pomerado Road adjacent to the campus of Chabad San \nDiego, a private primary school. The sponsor is seeking financing of $18.67MM or $222,362 per unit \nrepresenting 60% Loan to Value and 55% of Project costs incurred to date. The property completed \nconstruction Q4 2018 and is currently 73% leased as of January 2019 and is expected to be 95% leased \nprior to the funding of the take-out loan in March 2019. The proceeds from refinance will pay off the \nexisting construction loan and repatriate the sponsorship's equity for deployment into the second phase \nof \nthe project, an additional 144 apartment units currently being planned. \nProperty Quality: \nAscent features a unique urban/suburban design with each apartment building being elevator served with \nground floor garages (2-car for each 2-bedroom unit and 1-car for each 1-bedroom unit) and 4 units per \nfloor on the 3 residential floors above. The units feature large balconies, accentuating the indoor-outdoor \ndesign prevalent in most ColRich homes. Interior finishes include granite counter tops, stainless steel \nappliances, attractive contemporary cabinetry, large walk in closets and roman style bathtubs. Each \napartment is a corner unit with dual masters for all 2 bedroom 2 bath units. \nProperty Entitlements: \nThe property has a unique entitlement structure, having been originally approved in 1967 as part of a 435 \nacre conditional use permit (CUP) for a university master plan. That CUP specifically included an approval \nfor a 6,000 student university on one or more self-contained campuses, including housing for students \nand faculty. The university, United States International University (USIU) failed, and Chabad Education \nCampuses acquired 27 acres of the 435 acres for a K-12 private school and rabbinical seminary. \nPrior to the Saloner family involvement, the property was entitled for 280 residential units for students \nand teachers. ColRich acting as the developer, working with the Saloner family and the Chabad leadership, \nsuccessfully re-entitled the property through substantial conformance for 228 luxury student apartment \nunits. Under existing entitlements Campus of Life/Ascent can build 228 units to provide market rate \nhousing for students or teachers that satisfy the Chabad Lubavitch on-site \"life\" education program(s). \nBy working within the scope of the CUP approved in 1967, the Sponsorship was able to conform to the \nexisting zoning overlay and bypass a full rezone which would cost time and additional resources, including \nmore intense grading and engineering reviews, and most importantly any California Environmental \nQuality Act (CEQA) reviews. \nHFF \n2 \n", "609 North Clementine Street \nOCEANSIDE, CA \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nSection 1 \nPRICING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nSection 2 \nPROPERTY DESCRIPTION \nSection 3 \nRECENT SALES \nSection 4 \nIN ESCROW COMPARABLES \nSection 5 \nON MARKET COMPARABLES \nSection 6 \nRENT COMPARABLES \nSection 7 \nMARKET OVERVIEW \nSection 8 \nDEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS \nSection 9 \nMARKETING PLAN \nSection 10 \nPROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS \nSection 11 \nTHE MARCUS & MILLICHAP ADVANTAGE \nMarcus & Millichap \n", "PRESENTED B Y \nGregory Colligan \nAssociate \nAssociate Director - National Multi \nHousing Group \nSan Diego Office \nTel: (858) 373-3286 \nFax: (858) 373-3265 \ngregory.colligan@marcusmillichap.com \nLicense: CA 01943461 \nMarcus & Millichap \n3 \n", "UNIVERSITY \nLAKEWOOD \nPLACE \nTACOMA \n5 \nMILTON \n167 \nPUYALLUP \nSUMNER STATION \nSUMNER \nNor Westes \nAPARTMENTS \n410 \n", "8350 S.

The property includes \na two-story main building (7,087 SF) and a bungalow structure (1,070 SF) plus a gated parking lot with 10 \nspaces. \nSponsor's plan involves high-end interior updates and the expansion of recording and rehearsal space \n(increasing studio SF, no change to building envelope). Sponsor will utilize in-house, seasoned property \nmanagement to aggressively market and lease space at increased rental rates in this supply-constrained \nsubmarket. (Current owner is a real estate operator - does not even a website.) \nSponsor will leverage its deep industry experience and development capabilities to create the premier \nmusic studio facility in West Los Angeles and capture the unmet demand for high-end private studio space. \nEconomics \nThe property will offer short- and long-term lease options, as well as several amenities. Proforma monthly \nrents for studios (250 SF+) and rehearsal spaces (115 SF+) range from $1,000 for rehearsal spaces to \n$5,000 for the largest studio space. Proforma rent figures are in line with market rents for high-end space. \nThe proposed loan request of $6,900,000 provides the following deal-level economics: \nLoan Proceeds (Fully Funded): $6,900,000 \n($846 PSF) \nLTC: \n73% \nLTV: \n63% (6 cap on stabilized NOI) \nDebt Yield: \n9.4% (stabilized NOI) \nPurchase Price: \n$8,160,000 (including $160,000 Broker Fee) \nRenovation: \n$600,000 \nReserves/Closing: \n$720,500 \nTotal Project Cost: \n$9,480,500 \n($1,162 PSF) \nSponsor's attractive basis after renovations (sub-$1,200 PSF) is comparable to per square foot sales of \naged \"small box\" properties in Silicon Beach - which are coveted by single tenant users. \n2114 Pico Blvd \nPage 2 \n", "Pointe Inverness Office Building \nFORT WAYNE, IN \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nSection 1 \nPROPERTY DESCRIPTION \nSection 2 \nPRICING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nSection 3 \nMARKET OVERVIEW \nSection 4 \nDEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS \nMarcus & Millichap \n", "8350 S.

This 5,640 square foot complex sits just a few blocks south of Balboa park resting on a 7,000 square foot lot. Select \nunits include views of downtown, french doors facing out onto private fenced in yards and hardwood floors. The property consists \nof a two story spanish-style building and a second 1-story building collectively composed of six 1-bedroom / 1-bath units and five \nstudios units. There are 2 off-street spaces available with additional street easily accessible to tenants and a shared courtyard with \nlush garden landscaping. Owners benefit from the city paying for the trash expense and several new water heaters, fridges and \nstoves in select units. The property has mostly ABS piping under the building and the main and clean under the main building have \nbeen recently replaced. \nThe historic Golden Hill community has gone through a rapid gentrification, while still retaining the architectural style from its rich \nhistory as one of San Diego's communities for the wealthy elite. Golden Hill provides excellent access to some of San Diego's \nprime attractions such as downtown, Balboa Park and the neighboring urban mesa neighborhoods. Its location gives it \ntremendous accessibility to the I-5 and 94 freeways, making it easy for tenants to commute within the core San Diego area. This \ncomplex offers an investor an opportunity to own a property with value-add upside in a core San Diego neighborhood that has \ntightening vacancy rates and accelerating rent growth. \nPROPERTY OVERVIEW \nPrime location in a Recently Redeveloped Golden Hill \nResidential Community \nMix of 1-Bedroom / 1-Bath and Studio Units Ideal For Young \nGolden Hill Demographic \nSelect Units with Private Fenced Yards \nUnits with Hardwood Floors and French Doors \nEasy Downtown and Freeway Access \nMarcus & Millichap \n5 \n", "Marcus S Millichap \nEXCLUSIVE MULTIFAMILY OFFERING \n9 \n2559 WHITE OAK PLACE, ESCONDIDO, CA 92027 \n10 APARTMENT UNITS \nOPERATING DATA \nIncome \nCurrent \nPro Forma \nGross Potential Rent \n$120,000 \n$174,000 \nGross Potential Income \n$120,000 \n$174,000 \nLess: Vacancy/Deductions (GPR) \n4.0% /$4,800 \n4.0% / $6,960 \nEffective Gross Income \n$115,200 \n$167,040 \nLess: Expenses \n$39,874 \n$42,466 \nNet Operating Income \n$75,326 \n$124,574 \nNet Cash Flow Before Debt Service \n$75,326 \n$124,574 \nDebt Service \n$61,873 \n$61,873 \nDebt Coverage Ratio \n1.22 \n2.01 \nNet Cash Flow After Debt Service \n1.0% %/$13,453 \n4.8% / $62,701 \nPrincipal Reduction \n$19,019 \n$19,019 \nTotal Return \n2.5% / $32,472 \n6.2% /$81,720 \nEXPENSES \nReal Estate Taxes \n$22,914 \n$22,914 \nInsurance \n$2,200 \n$2,200 \nUtilities \n$4,000 \n$4,000 \nUNIT MIX \nRepairs & Maintenance \n$5,000 \n$5,000 \nUNIT \nAVERAGE. \nCURRENT AVG. \nAVERAGE \nMONTHLY \nPOTENTIAL \nAVERAGE \nMONTHLY \nCOUNT \nUNIT TYPE \nSQUARE FEET \nRENT \nRENT/SF \nINCOME \nRENTS \nRENT/SF \nINCOME \nManagement Fee \n$5,760 \n$8,352 \nTotal Expenses \n$39,874 \n$42,466 \n10 \n2Bdr 1Bath \n850 \n$10,000 \n$1,500 \n$1.76 \n$14,500 \nExpenses per SF \n$5.08 \n$5.41 \nThis information has been secured from sources we believe to be reliable, but we make no representations or warranties. express or implied, as to the accuracy of the information.

It is situated on a corner \n329 \nparcel totaling approximately 6,914 saft of land zoned R3. There is \ncurrently at least 9 surface parking spaces (4 in the two driveways in \nMadison St \nthe front off of Walnut Ave, 1 in the front driveway off of Madison St, \nand at least 4 additional rear parking spaces located in the alley). \nAdditional parking could be achieved by implementing tandem \nparking in the front driveways, which would add an additional 5 \nspaces.

Investor interest remains high here, as both buyers and sellers are active trad- \ning communities - most often among private parties. \nPersonality, position, and price make the Normal Heights submarket a renter's haven \nand keep a lid on vacancies. Any vacancy expansion is typically supply-induced, and \ngenerally regresses after lease up. Central to this submarket's draw is its walkability, \nhistorical relevance, and diversity, making it a target for Millennials. Thanks to ease of \naccess to arterial freeways, residents can reach the employment nodes of Downtown \nand the Golden Triangle in less than 30 minutes in traffic. \nFrom Bankers Hill and Hillcrest to North Park and Kensington, the submarket gives \nrenters their choice of character-laden neighborhoods (assuming availability). Restau- \nrants, shopping, and bars line main thoroughfares, offering residents the ability to \npark their cars on Friday after work and not move them until Monday morning. In addi- \ntion, Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo, both in close proximity, attract residents and \ntourists throughout the year, adding prestige unmatched by most submarkets in San \nDiego. \nSource: Costar \nJohn Ronis \nJose Magadan Jr. \nSales Professional \nSales Professional \njoronis@live.com \nmagadan.re@gmail.com \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY \n619.565.5616 \n619.894.2931 \nCA BRE #01846535 \nCA BRE #01876187 \nCalifornia Properties \nReal Estate Investment Services \n", "PROPERTY DESCRIPTION \nADDRESS \n939 E Washington Ave, El Cajon, CA 92020 \nPARKING \n39 Off-Street Spaces & 1 Garage \nAPN \n493-103-05-00 \nLAUNDRY \n3 Washers / 3 Dryers Leased by Coinmach \nZONING \nC-N \nWATER \nRUBS (Tenant pays % of Water/Sewer) \n# OF UNITS \n21* \nELECTRIC \nAll Electric Units/Tenant Pays \nAll Units with Patios/Balconies \nDishwashers \nGAS \n1 House Meter for 2 Water Heaters \nGranite Countertops \nTile Floors \nHEATING \nElectric Wall Heaters \n*1 Newly Rehabbed Non-Conforming Unit \nwith Separate Electric Meter \nA/C \nWall A/C in All Units \n# OF \n2 - 10 Units Buildings \nFOUNDATION \nConcrete Slab \nBUILDINGS \n1 - Separate 2 Bdrm / 2 Bath House \nw/ Attached Garage & W/D Hookups \nFRAMING \nWood \n# OF STORIES \n2 \nEXTERIOR \nStucco \nCOMMON \nSwimming Pool \nROOF \nFlat & Pitched \nAREAS \nJacuzzi \nRoofs Warrantied Until 2030 \nBBQ Area \nLaundry Facility \nSecure Gated Access \nYEAR BUILT \n1980 \nSQUARE FEET \n18,337 \nLOT SIZE \n.86 Acres / 37,461 sqft \nOWNERSHIP \nFee Simple \nLANDSCAPING \nLow Maintenance \nTOPOGRAPHY \nFlat \nThis information has been secured from sources we believe to be reliable, but we make no representations or warranties; expressed or \nimplied, as to the accuracy of the information References to square footage are approximate Buyer must verify the information and bears all \nMarcus & Millichap \nrisk for any inaccuracies Marcus & Millichap is a service mark of 2017 Marcus & Millichap All rights reserved \n", "km Kidder \nMathews \nThe Offering \nKidder Mathews is pleased to present 904 S.

Except for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, the tenant leases are triple net leases with tenants \npaying for taxes, insurance and operating expenses to include some management costs. \nTenant Health: Aldis, Planet Fitness and the Depart of Motor Vehicles, were in place before the super Wal-Mart was \nbuilt. These tenants have below market rents on long term leases with lease extensions. They would be hard \npressed to find another freeway location with low rents. \nDense Urban Population: 100k+ people < 3-mi, $68K avg. HH income. \nSuperior Retail Corridor: Super Wal-Mart development and the new Cabela's Super Store at the freeway. \nHigh Traffic Location: 50k+ on Indianapolis Blvd. \nEconomic Advantage: Lower Sales Tax: Because the property is located in Indiana near the state line of Illinois at the \nfreeway, shoppers have an incentive to travel [just a short distance] across the state line to shop in Lake County, \nIndiana where the property is located. The sales taxes in Lake County, Indiana is 7.0% (7.0% Indiana state sales \ntax \n+ \n0% Lake County tax). Neighboring Cook County, Illinois has a sales tax up to 10.5% (9.5% Illinois state sales tax + \n1.0% local tax) creating a 3.5% sales tax savings. \nGEOGRAPHIC LOCATION \nLocated in Hammond, IN at the full interchange of I-80/94 on Indianapolis Blvd. with strong daily traffic counts of \nover 50,000 on Indianapolis Blvd + 166,000 cars per day on the I-80/94 freeways. \nAcross from Cabela's Super Store, and a newer Walmart Superstore as well as Purdue University's Calumet Campus. \nKaplan Univ. adjacent to subject. \nWill Provide internal operating metrics to qualified \nSterling McGregor, President \nbuyers upon request to quailed buyers \nDealPoint Merrill \nDEALPOINT \n22815 Ventura Blvd., Suite 310 \nMERRILL \nWoodland Hills, CA 191364 \nOffice (310) 671-3900 \nwww.DealPointMerrill.com \nDisclaimer I Confidentiality \nThe sole purpose of this Investment Presentation Brochure is to assist the recipient in determining whether to proceed with an in-depth investigation of the co-investment opportunity within \nand \nis not to be used for any other purpose.

This location is heavily trafficked and ideally located within \nBallantyne's most desirable office and retail destination. Specifically, the \nproject is located in Ballantyne Village, a retail center that is central to \nthe Ballantyne Corporate Park and the area's neighborhoods. The project \nsponsorship is provided by Panorama Holdings, an experienced developer \nwith a successful track record of projects throughout the Charlotte MSA. \nTotal cost of the project is $92.6 million and the sponsor is seeking loan \nproceeds of $64.5 million (75% LTC) that is likely to be comprised of a senior \nnote and mezzanine or preferred equity. The stabilized NOI is anticipated \nto be $7.2 million, and at a blended market cap rate of 7.0% the project is \nanticipated to have a stabilized market value of $102.8 million. \nCharlotte is one of the nation's fastest growing cities with a surging \npopulation and job growth; averaging 50,000 jobs per year. Over the next 10 \nyears, the Charlotte MSA population is expected to balloon from 2.5 million \nto 3 million, making it the third fastest growing region in the nation. This \nrapid growth rate equates to adding approximately 151 residents per day. \nCharlotte's significant population growth is in part consequence to many \ncompanies choosing this area for headquarter expansions and relocations. \nThis is largely due to the area's pro-business policies, lower taxes, an \nabundance of talent and a cost of doing business that is 14% below the \nnational average. \nWe recommend this opportunity to you based on the market demand, \nexperienced sponsorship and well-positioned project.

The JV \nacquired the site in March 2015, and began construction the following year in 2016. The 21 story, 48 unit condominium tower was recently completed, and will have a TCO \nin October. \nThe project costs, including interest and carry, are currently pegged at $75.16mm, with $61.78mm in total debt (senior and mezz) the debt capital stack is made up of a \n$43.13mm senior loan from Capital Source, and a $18.65mm mezzanine loan from Terra Capital Group. In addition, the project was funded by $2.84mm in partnership \nloans for soft cost overages and reserve rebalancing leaving $10.55mm in cash equity in the deal. The Sponsor currently has 9 units under contract for $17.53mm \n($1,712 PSF, $1.95mm per unit on average), and plans to use the net proceeds of $16.36mm to de-lever and pay down the debt balance. \nWe are seeking a $51.84mm ($1,235 PSF, $1.33mm per unit) inventory loan to recapitalize the current debt, recap interest and carry reserves, cover closing costs, and \nrepay partner loans that were made for overages. At takeout, the project will have 39 condo units, with a total projected sellout of $71.62mm across 41,980 SF (1,706 PSF, \n$1.84mm per unit on average) in inventory. After broker/closing costs (estimated at 6%), the collateral has a projected net sellout of $67.32mm with an additional $1.8mm \nprojected from parking sales. The loan request represents 75.0% of the projected net sellout, and will be backed by $10.55mm in cash equity in the deal. \nCollateral Summary \nThe Vitre Condominium Tower is a recently completed 21 story residential building containing 48 condominiums across 52,217 net sellable SF, as well as indoor parking. \nThe building is a class A luxury building located on the upper east side, steps away from the new Q train stop at 96th and Second Ave. The building was designed by Karl \nFischer Architects and features an array of class A amenities (see Development Overview section). The Sponsor recently signed contracts on 9 out of the 48 residential \nunits, \nand \nplans \nto \nclose \non \nthem \nupon \nTCO \n(expected \nOctober \n2018). \nAs \nsuch, \nthe \ninventory \nloan \nwill \nbe \ncollateralized \nby \nthe \nremaining \n39 \nunits \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \ntakeout. \nThese 39 units are comprised of 41,980 interior SF, a summary of them can be found in the Schedule A section). In addition, the collateral include unsold parking \nunits. \nBusiness Plan \nThe Sponsor has positioned this condominium development as \"affordable luxury\", a niche which they consider to be their forte. This positioning is advantageous both from \na micro and macro perspective. On a micro level, the Upper East side is underserved by middle-class \"affordable luxury\" developments. On a macro level, these types of \ncondo projects have been far outperforming the ultra-luxury developments currently on the market city-wide. \nThe Sponsor has put together an institutional quality development team. On the principal side, the JV is made of Wonder Works Construction, Fimida Enterprises, and \nForbes Development - all of which have extensive development experience. The Sponsor hired starchitect Karl Fischer to conceptualize the project, and renowned interior \ndesigner Elianart for aesthetic work. Brown Harris Stevens, and REA group are handling sales / marketing. Much of the business plan is complete, as the building is weeks \naway from TCO and has significant sales velocity (18.8% of the units and 19.64% of the projected revenues currently under contract) \nMERIDIAN \nCAPITAL GROUP \n4 \n", "AREA PHOTOS \nSITE \nSITE \n6 \n- \n6 \nGoogle F \nBldgs./ Houses \n3 Curb Cuts \nDirectly Across Hwy 503; National Branded Businesses \nView Listings >>> www.SheaCRe.com \n", "INVESTMENT OVERVIEW \nSANTA FE VILLAS \nPROPERTY OVERVIEW \nACRE Investment Real Estate Services is pleased to present for sale Santa Fe Villas, an \neight (8) unit apartment building located in the desirable Vista market of North \nCounty San Diego. Built in 1968 the subject property is situated on a 20,450 square \nfoot lot. \nThe property is comprised of eight (8), two-bedroom/one-bath units totaling \napproximately 5,992 rentable square feet. The complex consists of two newly painted \nwood framed paneled buildings, with concrete slab foundations and new pitched \nroofs. Residents enjoy private back patios for each dwelling as well as ample on-site \nparking with carports that include large attached storage units. \nThe offering is an opportunity for an investor to purchase a solid investment in a high \ndemand rental location. As an added benefit, the size of the lot allows an investor to \nincrease potential income by building a laundry room and additional storage \nunits. This property is a true Value-Add opportunity as one of the units has been \nremodeled and now getting the highest rent for a two-bedroom/one-bath in the \nneighborhood. So the potential for the remaining 7 is only limited by the imagination \nof the new owner. \nThe Santa Fe Villas are near Vista's transit center where tenants have access to both \nbus and rail. In addition, Vista Village is just down the road where one will find major \nretailers and the redeveloped downtown Vista area. \nOFFERING MEMORANDUM \n811 N SANTA F E AVE. VISTA.

Its location is in the \nConcho Valley, a region of West Texas between the Permian Basin to the northwest, Chihuahuan \nDesert to the southwest, Osage Plains to the northeast, and Central Texas to the southeast. \nAccording to a 2014 Census estimate, San Angelo has a total population of 100,450. It is the \nprincipal city and center of the San Angelo metropolitan area, which has a population of \n118,182.San Angelo is home to Angelo State University, historic Fort Concho, and Goodfellow \nAir Force Base. \nSan Angelo has consistently been ranked by many publications and rankings as one of the best \nsmall cities for business and employment. In 2013, it ranked fourth in the nation in Forbes \nmagazine's \"Best Small Cities For Jobs\" rankings. In 2010, Kiplinger's Personal Finance named \nSan Angelo as one of the \"Best Cities of the Next Decade\". In 2009, CNN Money ranked San \nAngelo as one of the best cities to launch a small business. \nSan Angelo has a diverse economy for a city of its size. Although most oil fields lie to the west, \nmany oil-field service companies based in the city employ a large number of local residents. The \nagricultural industry in San Angelo remains strong. Producer's Livestock Auction is the nation's \nlargest for sheep and lambs, and is among the top five in the nation for cattle auctions. Though \nmost agricultural work is done outside the city, thousands of employees work in the cattle and \nlamb meat-processing industries, and many more work in agriculture supporting roles inside the \ncity. Two agricultural research centers are located in San Angelo: the Angelo State University \nManagement Instruction and Research Center and the Texas A&M Texas AgriLife Research and \nExtension Center at San Angelo. \nThe telecommunication industry is a strong employer in San Angelo. Sitel has a call center in \nSan Angelo. In addition, Frontier Communications, Performant Recovery Inc. (formerly DCS), a \ndebt recovery corporation, and Blue Cross all employ over 1,000 each individuals locally. San \nAngelo serves as the regional medical center for west-central Texas. Shannon Medical Center \nand Community Medical Center employ over 3,000 in San Angelo, and provide services to a \nlarge region of west-central Texas. The manufacturing industry has seen hits since the 1990s; \nhowever, many large employers still remain, including Ethicon a division of Johnson & Johnson, \nConner Steel, and Hirschfield Steel. \nThe several large institutional employers in the city include Shannon Medical Center, Angelo \nState University, and Goodfellow Air Force Base. The latter remains the largest employer in the \nregion. \n", "BRANFORD \n45 SOUTH \nCONNECTICUT \nMAIN \nLOCATION \nSouthwest corner of Eades Street \nLOT SIZE \n35,719 SF \nSPACE \nGround Floor \n9,552 SF \nSecond Floor \n9,552 SF \nREAL ESTATE TAXES \n$41,980 per annum \nSITE STATUS \nFormerly Capital One \nLOT FRONTAGE \n150 FT on South Main Street \n245 FT on Eades Street \nZONING \n45 SOUTH MAIN STREET \nBR (Town of Branford) \nBOOK / PAGE \n982 / 643 \nPARKING \n30 spaces \n>IN \nNewmark \nKnight Frank \n", "EXECUTIVE \nII \nSUMMARY SU M M \nB \nPe Healt \nlealth \nlite \nJolla \n", "EXCLUSIVE MULTIFAMILY \nOFFERING \nPORTER HOUSE \nPORTER HOUSE \n209 E MAIN ST \nBELOIT, KS 67420 \nPORTER HOUSE \n30 UNITS \n1 \nBUILT: 1920'S \nBERKADIA \na Berkshire Hathaway and \nJefferies Financial Group company \n", "3364 Mission Boulevard \nSAN DIEGO, CA \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nSection 1 \nPRICING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nSection 2 \nPROPERTY DESCRIPTION \nSection 3 \nRECENT SALES \nSection 4 \nRENT COMPARABLES \nSection 5 \nMARKET OVERVIEW \nSection 6 \nDEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS \nMarcus & Millichap \n", "1123 CALLA AVE AVE \nINVESTMENT \nOVERVIEW \nMarcus & Millichap \n4 \n", "RANCHO DRIVE APARTMENTS \nSingle Story 10 Plex \nInstant Cash-Flow \nFantastic Location \nLarge Kitchen areas \nFantastic Frontage on Rancho \nDirectly Across from Casino to Appeal to Employees as Tenants \nROTHWELL GORNT \nRICHARD CRIGHTON - (702) 768.5755 \nCOMPANIES \nCHRIS BROWN \n- (702) 445.1330 \n", "T TOP GUN CRE \nExecutive Summary \nLocation \nUnits \nEst.

Though the area was originally settled in 1654 by Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant and was \nnamed \"Nieuw Haarlem,\" the name was changed to \"Harlem\" with the arrival of the English in 1664. The \nregion's flat land provided some of New York's most illustrious early families with vast farms and estates. \nIn the 1800s, East Harlem developed into an early railroad suburb that provided housing for working-class \nimmigrants relocating from the overcrowded Lower East Side. The earliest waves of immigrants to occupy \neast \nHarlem were predominantly poor German and Irish families, followed by Italian and European Jewish \nfamilies. In the mid-1900s, Puerto Ricans and African-Americans began settling there as other groups left. \nThe community is often referred to as \"Spanish Harlem\" or \"EI Barrio.\" In the 1960s, Harlem experienced a \ndetrimental decline as middle-class families moved to safer parts of the city and the booming suburbs. \nCrime soared, buildings were abandoned, and the community experienced bleak times for several \ngenerations. In the 1990s, a new Harlem Renaissance began to emerge \nWhile other parts of Manhattan like SoHo, TriBeca, and the Lower East Side were quickly developing into \nsome of the most highly desired and expensive places to live, developers began to realize Harlem's \npotential as the next revitalized area of Manhattan. Enjoying an inventory of both large and architecturally \ndistinct buildings, vast parcels of vacant land, and some of the most efficient transportation networks to \nLower Manhattan and the outer boroughs, East Harlem possesses an urban infrastructure ripe for \ndevelopment. A combination of political, economic and social factors has contributed to East Harlem's \ntremendous growth. First, the city government encouraged developers through multiple channels, \nincluding re-zoning proposals, innovative tax breaks, and incentives for developers to develop free market \nand low income housing. Economically, interest rates have remained low, providing both developers and \nresidential buyers with cheap financing. Perhaps most importantly, crime diminished to a level that no \nlonger dissuaded newcomers. These factors, coupled with the fact that one could purchase an East \nHarlem residence for half the price as of one below 96th Street, made the neighborhood a viable \ninfo@thevkg.com \nwww.thevkg.com \n484-680-4342 \n", "3762-64 36TH ST \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nSECTION \nINVESTMENT OVERVIEW \n01 \nOffering Summary \nRegional Map \nLocal Map \nAerial Photo \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n02 \nRent Roll Summary \nPricing Detail \nMARKET COMPARABLES \n03 \nSales Comparables \nRent Comparables \nMARKET OVERVIEW \n04 \nMarket Analysis \nDemographic Analysis \nMarcus & Millichap \n3 \n", "RITE AID \nRITE AID \nGNC Live Well.

(Activity ID: Z0090560 Property ID: 499279) \n", "Northern Colorado Market \nFort Collins/Greeley MSAs \nMarcus & Millichap \nMarket Highlights \nDiverse economy attracts residents to Northern Colorado, keeps demand strong \nfor apartments. Healthcare, education, technology and government are just a few sec- \ntors of employment that have a large presence in the Northern Colorado region. A diverse \nand growing economy, as well as a relatively affordable cost of living, has boosted popu- \nlation growth and household formation in the area, boding well for apartment operations. \nVacancy is tight, encouraging developers to move forward with apartment projects, and \ndeliveries this year will reach a new peak. Though supply additions are outweighing de- \nmand, the rate remains lower than other markets in the state. The use of concessions as \nnew units are brought into service is decreasing the overall effective rent, but a thinning \nconstruction pipeline will help lease concerns and that softening vacancy and dip in rents \nfor select areas will be temporary. \nIntense buyer competition in Denver metro area encourages investors to seek \nassets in Northern Colorado. Limited development over the past several years and \ntight vacancy is luring a number of buyers north. Private, local investors in particular \nare seeking apartment assets in the area for higher yields than those realized in nearby \nDenver. In the last year, apartment sales activity surged. A number of private groups, \ninstitutional funds and REITs are also targeting properties in the region, boosting sales \nof assets priced above $10 million and compressing the overall cap rate. Rising interest \nrates will encourage additional investors to seek properties here through 2017 as returns \nsqueeze in nearby markets. This will increase buyer competition and bode well for owners \nchoosing to capitalize on increased property values. \nMajor Employers \nMarket Map \nSouk County \nPlattelCount \nGoshen Cosintly \nScoffs \nCarbon \nColorado State University \nCounty \nBluff Scottabluff \nCounty \nPoudre School District \nAlbany County \nBanner County \nWal-Mart \nLarame \nBanner Health Systems \nLaramie \n(Courity \nKiminall \nUniversity of Colorado Health \nCheyenne \nCounty \nCenter Partners Inc. \nJBS \nNorthern Colorado University \nJackson \nWeld County \nLarimer County \nCounty \nWoodward Inc. \nFort Collins \nLoveland Greeley \nHewlett-Packard \nMorgan County \nBoulder \nFor Morgan \nCompletions \nCourity Longment \nGrand County \nBoulder \nBrighton \nGlae \nAdams County \nWashing \nCounty \ncreek \nAurora \nArapahoo \nCounty \nJeffocabe \nCounty \nCounty \nParker \nCastle Rock \nDougles \nElbert County \nCounts \n", "MT VILEW \nA P A RTMENTS \ni.i. \n- \nPARAGON N \nREAL ESTATE ADVISORS \n", "ON-ENDORSEMENT - AND DISCLAIMER NOTICE \nConfidentiality and Disclaimer \nThe information contained in the following Marketing Brochure is proprietary and strictly confidential.
